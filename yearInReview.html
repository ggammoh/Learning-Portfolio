                                This year has been so fulfilling for me; I have come many steps closer to Christ, I have learned accountability, and I have delved into some social connections that are dear to my heart. All these experiences have taught me resilience and personal growth.
                            </p>
                            <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
                                The journey began by imbibing closeness with Christ. In high school, my association with Young Life led me to a leader who started mentoring and holding me accountable. But stepping out of that structured environment meant that I would have to learn how to sustain my faith on my own. This was kind of frightening, but it ended up being a great time of opportunity for growth. It showed me that for my faith to mature and be robust, external accountability couldn't cut it; it had to be nurtured from within. By maintaining regular prayer, scripture study, and engaging with my housemates, I learned to keep myself accountable. This has empowered me in my spiritual journey, reinforcing my hardiness through grounding in a faith that I could maintain individually.
                            </p>
                            <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
                                I also accepted the fact that I will not be excellent at everything, and that is absolutely fine. This year, I learned to let go of the pressure to be the best at everything I do. Acceptance made me more accepting of my abilities and flaws, which allowed me to have a healthier image of myself and let go of much unnecessary stress. This also made me feel humble and instilled in me the lesson of how important it is to be persistent. I began to see failures as not just failures, but stepping-stones toward my growth. It grabbed the importance of moving on despite the challenges and obstacles as this change of attitude develops resilience.
                            </p>
                            <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
                                Socially, I grew drastically after I learned how to make meaningful relationships and give time to them accordingly. I had just joined the dance group in school, UC Dhadak, hoping to forge some lasting relations, which did not justify the amount of time and effort it demanded. I finally took the hard and challenging decision of leaving the group. It was a pivotal decision to learn the value of investing time and energy in things and communities that truly look after my social and emotional health. I reallocated that new time to more rewarding endeavors, which helped a community develop around me that is supportive and enriching. Prior to this year I believed that I was better than average at being intentional with my friends but I was able to see just how much I could improve and how that could better my relationships with others.
                            </p>
                            <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
                                Going forward, I intend to use my resources and support to preserve and grow this development. I’ve found a strong church community that I am working to get more involved in. I’ll also make regular checks with mentors and friends to keep me accountable in the development of both my spiritual and personal life. I plan to utilize the tools of journaling and goal setting to trace my progress and reflect upon my journey. I'll achieve this by developing a support network and using practical tools for self-accountability that, when combined, will help me build and sustain the growth I've achieved this year.
                            </p>
                            <p class="me-4" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
                                In sum, the takeaway from this year is a transformation in deepening my spirituality, embracing self-accountability, and building relationships. It enhanced my resilience, and that is what all my experiences have contributed to. Therefore, I will continue to bring out my support network and available resources for personal development and growth continuously.
